    <!-- Anatomy Section -->
    <div class="section" id="plant-anatomy">
        <h2>Understanding Plant Anatomy</h2>
        <p>Knowing the anatomy of the plant is key to maximizing growth and yield. Each part of the plant plays a role in photosynthesis, nutrient uptake, and development.</p>

        <h3>Roots</h3>
        <p>The root system anchors the plant and absorbs water and essential nutrients. Strong, healthy roots are fundamental to successful growth.</p>
        <!-- Image Placeholder for Roots -->

        <h3>Stem</h3>
        <p>The stem transports nutrients and water throughout the plant. It also provides structural support, allowing leaves to reach the light.</p>
        <!-- Image Placeholder for Stem -->
        <img src="INSERT_STEM_IMAGE_LINK_HERE" alt="Stem of a Plant">

        <h3>Leaves</h3>
        <p>Leaves are the main site for photosynthesis, where sunlight is converted into energy. They also help regulate water loss through small openings called stomata.</p>
        <!-- Image Placeholder for Leaves -->
        <img src="INSERT_LEAF_IMAGE_LINK_HERE" alt="Close-up of a Plant Leaf">

        <h3>Flowers</h3>
        <p>The flowers are the plant’s reproductive organs and are crucial for producing seeds and, ultimately, the harvest.</p>

    <!-- Physiology Section -->
    <div class="section" id="plant-physiology">
        <h2>Plant Physiology</h2>
        <p>Plants convert light into energy through photosynthesis, a process that occurs mainly in the leaves. Water and nutrients are taken up through the roots and transported to the leaves, where chlorophyll pigments absorb light and produce energy.</p>
        <p>Key processes like nutrient uptake, transpiration, and photosynthesis all contribute to growth. Understanding these processes can help you optimize conditions for plant health and productivity.</p>

    <!-- Nutrient Basics (N-P-K) and Fertigation Techniques -->
    <div class="section" id="nutrients-fertigation">
        <h2>Nutrient Basics (N-P-K) & Fertigation Techniques</h2>
        
        <h3>N-P-K Ratios</h3>
        <p>The three primary nutrients plants need are nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). Here’s a basic breakdown of their roles:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Nitrogen (N)</strong>: Promotes leaf growth and overall plant vigor.</li>
            <li><strong>Phosphorus (P)</strong>: Supports root development and flower/bud formation.</li>
            <li><strong>Potassium (K)</strong>: Essential for overall health, improves disease resistance and stress tolerance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Fertigation Techniques</h3>
        <p>Fertigation is a method of delivering nutrients through irrigation, allowing for precise control over the amount and timing of nutrient delivery. Here are some popular fertigation techniques:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Drip Irrigation</strong>: Minimizes water and nutrient waste by delivering them directly to the roots.</li>
            <li><strong>Flood and Drain</strong>: Nutrient solution floods the grow area and is then drained away, effective for hydroponic systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Foliar Feeding</strong>: Nutrients are sprayed onto leaves for direct absorption, ideal for quick nutrient uptake during specific growth phases.</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- Grow Mediums Section -->
    <div class="section" id="grow-mediums">
        <h2>Grow Mediums</h2>
        <p>Choosing the right grow medium is essential, as it affects water retention, root aeration, and nutrient availability. Here’s an overview of three common mediums:</p>

        <h3>Soil</h3>
        <p>Soil is a natural medium that provides nutrients and stability. It’s ideal for beginners due to its forgiving nature.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pros</strong>: Holds nutrients well, easy for beginners, provides natural microbial life.</li>
            <li><strong>Cons</strong>: Slower growth compared to other mediums, risk of pests, pH needs frequent monitoring.</li>
        </ul>
        <!-- Image Placeholder for Soil Setup -->
        <img src="INSERT_SOIL_IMAGE_LINK_HERE" alt="Soil-based Grow Setup">

        <h3>Coco Coir</h3>
        <p>Made from coconut husks, coco coir is a sustainable, lightweight, and pH-neutral option.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pros</strong>: Good aeration, better water retention than soil, eco-friendly.</li>
            <li><strong>Cons</strong>: Requires specific nutrients, must be kept moist, can attract mold if not maintained.</li>
        </ul>
        <!-- Image Placeholder for Coco Coir Setup -->
        <img src="INSERT_COCO_COIR_IMAGE_LINK_HERE" alt="Coco Coir-based Grow Setup">

        <h3>Hydroponics</h3>
        <p>Hydroponics is a soil-less system where plants grow in a nutrient-rich solution, promoting faster growth and higher yields.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pros</strong>: Rapid growth, efficient nutrient use, no soil pests.</li>
            <li><strong>Cons</strong>: Requires careful monitoring, high initial cost, potential for root diseases in unclean water.</li>
        </ul>
